    <p>Hi! My name is Ahriane! I am a freelance web developer. I found myself coding one day out of frustration of
      having business ideas that couldn't
      make possible without knowing how to write a line of code.
      Although I am versatile by nature, I find fulfillment in web design ‚ô•.
      I am a firm believer that you should do what you love doing (I learned that the hard way), so here I am now,
      typing away.
      I am in pursuit of a new career that I love doing - bringing ideas to life.
      I love talking to people about designs and building it for them. It gives me a great sense of fulfillment when I
      see them happy with the outcome.

      <!-- I am a team player with excellent communication skills and also work well independently.
      Natural leadership skills that can drive and lead a team to successful goal outcome. 
      Project management expertise to provide good quality product and meeting deadlines.
      Detail-oriented 
      My diverse background in the accounting field gained me versatility to easily adapt to new environment, team, and system. -->

      When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll find me at a nearby kickboxing gym in my area.
      My other hobbies and interests are painting, drawing, photography, playing the piano and guitar, and watching
      movies.

      Hit me up to collab on a project or simply you're a coffee person like me ‚òï
