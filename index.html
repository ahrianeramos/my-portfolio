            üëã Hi! My name is Ahriane! I am a freelance web developer. I found myself coding one day out of frustration
            of
            having business ideas that couldn't
            be possible without knowing how to write a line of code.
            Although I am versatile by nature, I find fulfillment in web design ‚ô•.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am a firm believer that you should do what you love doing (I learned that the hard way), so here I am
            now,
            typing away.
            I am in pursuit of a new career that I love doing - bringing ideas to life üå†.
            I love talking to people about designs and building it for them. It gives me a great sense of fulfillment
            when I
            see them happy with the outcome.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll find me at a nearby kickboxing gym in my area ü•ä.
            My other hobbies and interests are üé® painting, ‚úè drawing, üì∏ photography, üéµ playing the piano and guitar,
            and üé• watching
            movies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hit me up to collab on a project or simply because you're a coffee person like me ‚òï
